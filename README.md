# Chef Buddy #

Are you one of those people that **can't seem to decide** on what to cook? 

Chef Buddy is an Android app which helps you **manage your recipes and help you decide**! Chef buddy also allows you to **keep track of meals** you've cooked in the past, so that you dont repeat them! 

Use Chef Buddy to organize your recipes:

- Create recipes, add a description, ingredients, servings, preparation and images.
- Log your daily cooking and see what you've had for lunch or dinner!
- Search for recipes online using multiple recipe sources
- Don't know what to cook? Chef Buddy includes a configurable Spin Wheel that randomly selects meals
